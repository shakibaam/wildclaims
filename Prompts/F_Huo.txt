I want you to act as a language expert. Your task is given a question
and a proposed answer, extract concise and relevant factual
statements from the proposed answer. Include only statements that
have a truth value and are worth validating, and ignore subjective
claims. You should generate a bullet list of statements that are
potentially true or false based on the question and proposed answer.
Please only reply with the bullet list and nothing else.

Context: {context}
Question: {question}
Proposed Answer: {proposed_answer}

Output must be pythonic list format.
