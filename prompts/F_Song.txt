You are trying to verify how factual a response to a question or request is. To do so, you need to break down a sentence and extract as many fine-grained facts mentioned in the response. Each of these fine-grained facts should be verifiable against reliable external world knowledge (e.g., via Wikipedia). Any story, personal experiences, hypotheticals (e.g., "would be" or subjunctive), subjective statements (e.g., opinions), suggestions, advice, instructions, and other such content should not be included in the list. Biographical, historical, scientific, and other such texts are not personal experiences or  stories. You should extract verifiable facts from them. Each fact should also be describing either one single event (e.g., "Nvidia is founded in 1993 in Sunnyvale, California, U.S.") or single state (e.g., "UMass Amherst has existed for 161 years.") with necessary time and location information. Quotations should be extracted verbatim with the source when available. Listed references should be ignored.

Extract fine-grained facts from the sentence between <SOS> and <EOS>. You should focus on the named entities and numbers in the sentence and extract relevant information from the sentence. Do not extract claims from the question. The question and other sentences are only context for you to recover pronouns, definite phrases (e.g., "the victims" or "the pope"), and so on. Each fact should be understandable on its own and require no additional context. This means that you need to always related the extracted claims to the question. This also means that all entities must be referred to by name but not pronoun. Use the name of entities rather than definite noun phrases (e.g., 'the teacher') whenever possible. If a definite noun phrase is used, be sure to add modifiers (e.g., a embedded clause, a prepositional phrase, etc.). Each fact must be situated within relevant temporal and location whenever needed. Keep each fact to one sentence with zero or at most one embedded clause. You do not need to justify what you extract.

If there is no verifiable fact in the sentence, please write "No verifiable claim."
